<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a M.S.E. Student in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, advised by Prof. Luana Ruiz. My primary interests lie in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I have hands-on experience with Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, and have worked on several projects involving Time Series Analysis, LLMs and GNNs.

Currently, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in the fields of Time Series Analysis, LLMs, GNNs, AI, and data science, where I can apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to the development and deployment of advanced AI models. Please feel free to connect with me via email for job opportunities.
