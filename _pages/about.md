<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a M.S.E. Student in [Data Science of AMS](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/academics/graduate-studies/ms-in-data-science/) (Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics) at the Whiting School of Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Prof. Luana Ruiz](https://luanaruiz9.github.io/). My primary interests lie in Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I have hands-on experience with **Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch**, and have worked on several projects involving **Time Series Analysis, LLMs and GNNs**.

Currently, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in the fields of **Time Series Analysis, LLMs, GNNs, AI, and Data Science**, where I can apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to the development and deployment of advanced AI models. Please feel free to connect with me via email for job opportunities.
